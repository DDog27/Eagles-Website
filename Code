    <h2>Who are the Eagles?</h2>
    <p>The Eagles were founded in 1933 by Bert Bell and Lud Wray and are part of the National Football Conference
        in the NFL. Some notable current and former players include Brian Dawkins, Reggie White, Jalen Hurts and Jason Kelce. 
    They are currently owned by Jeff Laurie and are one of the favorites to win the Super Bowl this year. </p>
    <p>Overall, the team has won one super bowl, when they defeated the New England Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl 52. Quarterback Nick 
        Foles won Super Bowl MVP, and the game was headlined by the philly special. After the game, celebrations broke out in Philadelphia and 
        a superbowl parade was held on the Thursday after the game. That remains their only super bowl win and one of their three Super Bowl appearences the other two coming in
        the 1980 and 2022 seasons.
